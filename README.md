# Image-reconstruction-by-CT-technique
This is a course report for a mathematical modeling course. We modeled CT images using three methods: inverse radon transform, filtered inverse projection and ART.
The CT images in this project were derived from CT images of the lungs of a COVID-19 infected patient
